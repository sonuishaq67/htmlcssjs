When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye
I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
<b>I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace</b>
I could've stayed
But I chose the life
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up till tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure
So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered
Because I chose the life
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
<b>I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway</b>
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye
There's no one inside
But you're free to relax
<b>If you commit to this ride
There's no turning back</b>
You've been here before
Remember these sheets?
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
There's no need to hide
Don't overreact
<b>You said you've been to the sky
We'll go beyond that</b>
You've been here before, girl
Remember these sheets
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
I could teach you to dream, oooh
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky
How does it feel?
Do you feel like you did before?
Do you see the world getting small?
How does it feel, are you free?
As for me, I've been getting grown
As for me, I've been getting old
As for me, I’ve been flying around the world
I’ve been killing these shows
<b>But I'm always getting high
Cause my confidence low</b>
And I'm always in a rush
Ain't no time to fuck slow
And even if I try
It's not something I would know
But I'm sure I'll make you cum
Do it three times in a row
And I'm sure you would have left
Put that pussy in control
Got that pussy in control
I got it in control
Control, control, control
I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well
I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
<b>I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too</b>
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could
<b>Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world</b>
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby
I'm not a fool (I'm not a fool)
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool, (Oh no) I'm just lifeless too (I'm just lifeless too)
<b>But you taught me how to feel (You taught me how to feel)
When nobody ever would (When nobody ever would)
And you taught me how to love (You taught me how to love)
When nobody ever could (Oh babe, oh babe)</b>
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you (I know I should leave you)
And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you)
'Cause you belong to the world (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you (Oh babe, I wanna embrace you)
Domesticate you (Domesticate you)
But you belong to the world (Oh baby)
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
<b>You belong to the loneliness of filling every need</b>
Oh no, you belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world, ooh yeah
And ooh girl, I want to embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
<b>Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy</b>
But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don’t hold back
<b>You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body</b>
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
<b>And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'</b>
Said I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh yeah, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh yeah, don’t hold back
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
<b>Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones</b>
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
<b>I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose</b>
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
<b>I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep…</b>
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
<b>This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried</b>
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
They all feel the same
<b>Adjust to the fame
Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain</b>
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
<b>Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless</b>
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain, hmm)
When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
<b>And even if I changed
It would be too late</b>
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch
<b>They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame, ooh</b>
'Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain)
So now that she's gone (Oh no)
Embrace all that comes (Embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
<b>Don't show the world how alone you've become (Alone you've become)</b>
They all feel the same
I should've let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
<b>I could've set you free
But I'm selfish
I watched you stay, oh</b>
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
<b>So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away</b>
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
They all feel the same (Ooh)
Adjust to the fame (Adjust to the fame, and)
'Cause no one will love you, like her (No one could love me)
It's pointless (No one could love me)
Like tears in the rain (No one can love)
So now that she's gone (Oh, now that she's gone, baby)
Embrace all that comes (Oh, embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (I have nothing to show no more) (Oh, how alone I've become)
They all feel the same (Ooh, baby)
Adjust to the fame (Ohh, adjust to the fame, I ain't tryin' to be alone, baby)
'Cause no one will love you, like her (No one's gonna love you no more)
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
So now that she's gone (Ooh, baby) (No one's gonna love me no more)
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (No one's gonna love me)
<b>She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away</b>
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
