                When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
                So your heart won't lead you to anyone
                When the sun goes down, I know what you become
                You become awake, unlike the rest of us
                The afternoon has gently passed me by
                The evening spreads its sail against the sky
                Waiting for tomorrow
                Just another day
                God bid yesterday goodbye
                I lay my head on a thousand beds
                It's been a test to see how far a man
                Can go without himself
                <b>I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
                        Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace</b>
                        I could've stayed
                        But I chose the life
                        I chose the life
                        Then I realized
                        She might have been the one
                        I let it go
                        For a little fun
                        I made a trade
                        Gave away our days
                        For a little fame
                        Now I'll never see your face
                        But it's okay I adapted anyway
                        Adapted to these models
                        Who's adapted to the bottle
                        They take it down like water
                        Just to burn away their sorrows
                        I'll stay up till tomorrow
                        Just to tear down all their morals
                        And all is fair in Love and War
                        She's pure
                        So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
                        And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered
                        Because I chose the life
                        I chose the life
                        Then I realized
                        She might have been the one
